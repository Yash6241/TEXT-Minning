Over the years, it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months. Amid these challenging times Apple, like a bunch of other companies, has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iPhones. In this series, the company, as is customary, announced the iPhone 13 as its successor to last year‚Äôs iPhone 12.The newly launched iPhone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iPhone 12, which includes a smarter camera, a brighter display, a bigger battery and of course, a more advanced processor to name a few. Then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage. Sure, it‚Äôs a tad bit heavier than the iPhone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iPhone models, like the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR that I have been using, for what seems like aeons now, you will be grateful for everything that the iPhone 13 offers.</td>\n",

       "326  The smartphone marketplace has changed drastically over the span of the past few years. Over the years, it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months. Amid these challenging times Apple, like a bunch of other companies, has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iPhones. In this series, the company, as is customary, announced the iPhone 13 as its successor to last year‚Äôs iPhone 12.The newly launched iPhone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iPhone 12, which includes a smarter camera, a brighter display, a bigger battery and of course, a more advanced processor to name a few. Then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage. Sure, it‚Äôs a tad bit heavier than the iPhone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iPhone models, like the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR that I have been using, for what seems like aeons now, you will be grateful for everything that the iPhone 13 offers.\n",

Over the years, it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months. Amid these challenging times Apple, like a bunch of other companies, has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iPhones. In this series, the company, as is customary, announced the iPhone 13 as its successor to last year‚Äôs iPhone 12.The newly launched iPhone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iPhone 12, which includes a smarter camera, a brighter display, a bigger battery and of course, a more advanced processor to name a few. Then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage. Sure, it‚Äôs a tad bit heavier than the iPhone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iPhone models, like the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR that I have been using, for what seems like aeons now, you will be grateful for everything that the iPhone 13 offers.</td>\n",

       "326  The smartphone marketplace has changed drastically over the span of the past few years. Over the years, it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months. Amid these challenging times Apple, like a bunch of other companies, has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iPhones. In this series, the company, as is customary, announced the iPhone 13 as its successor to last year‚Äôs iPhone 12.The newly launched iPhone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iPhone 12, which includes a smarter camera, a brighter display, a bigger battery and of course, a more advanced processor to name a few. Then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage. Sure, it‚Äôs a tad bit heavier than the iPhone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iPhone models, like the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR that I have been using, for what seems like aeons now, you will be grateful for everything that the iPhone 13 offers.\n",

Amid these challenging times Apple, like a bunch of other companies, has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iPhones. In this series, the company, as is customary, announced the iPhone 13 as its successor to last year‚Äôs iPhone 12.The newly launched iPhone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iPhone 12, which includes a smarter camera, a brighter display, a bigger battery and of course, a more advanced processor to name a few. Then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage. Sure, it‚Äôs a tad bit heavier than the iPhone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iPhone models, like the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR that I have been using, for what seems like aeons now, you will be grateful for everything that the iPhone 13 offers.</td>\n",

       "326  The smartphone marketplace has changed drastically over the span of the past few years. Over the years, it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months. Amid these challenging times Apple, like a bunch of other companies, has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iPhones. In this series, the company, as is customary, announced the iPhone 13 as its successor to last year‚Äôs iPhone 12.The newly launched iPhone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iPhone 12, which includes a smarter camera, a brighter display, a bigger battery and of course, a more advanced processor to name a few. Then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage. Sure, it‚Äôs a tad bit heavier than the iPhone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iPhone models, like the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR that I have been using, for what seems like aeons now, you will be grateful for everything that the iPhone 13 offers.\n",

than 8 months . superb camera & audio quality is great.display is what something i cant describe its great . this is my secondary i am only using for work & finance . i am very pleased that i bought the original iphone 13.just shifted from android to ios .. the new iphone 13 is a great phone with a lot of improvements . it has the best camera on the market .. it works good in low light , the software is much improved , and the battery life is long lasting.got this for - 66 k good things 1 . camera as always amazing ( cinematic vedio is wow ) . 2 . battery performance has improved tremendously 3 . no lags 4 . size is good , good for watching movies . 5 . look is above average.not good 1 . charger not available ( whatever logic company gives , it should be available , one have a buy ) , people buying iphone can buy the charger additionally but that doesn\\'t mean they will be excluded üòÇ little doubtful earlier since it is for the first time i have purchase anything of this hefty amount of money through amazon , but now 100 % satisfied , i thank amazon and apple for keeping this confidence and trust ... got best deal thru amazon - in market it is approx 7000 / - costlier ... also received invoice bill and packing slip along with it . now just wanted to visit apple service center for further registration and warranty confirmation . good deal and a value for money product . happy with the performance . well except that the product delivered was manufactured way back in april and the box looked old from outside . i didn\\'t find anything negative . the phone works normal till date . amazing camera . loved how it syncs automatically with the ipad and how they work together to make my life tad a bit easier . amazing experience and believe me by switching from android will give confidence in day to day life too . no comments about the product . could have done better job with advertised battery life . great sound quality , fantastic camera photos , snug fit and the health functions are really helpful and informative . the only issue i ‚Äô m struggling to resolve are the 3rd gen iphone ear buds . only the left ear bud works . tried everything but it doesn ‚Äô t work . and amazon service is terribly unhelpful moving from android to ios was not very easy however , now settling down slowly after initially facing lots of issue . was expecting more from camera particularly in photo section and battery . rest only time will tell if a u turn would be needed or not . do not buy it if you have iphone 12 , there is no major difference . i ‚Äô m little worried about battery life , it doesn ‚Äô t look super promising . the battery life is average comparing to my previous samsung camera is good and multimedia experience also the best i have ever experienced in a phone the size is compactible just ok and overall i am satisfied with iphone 13 nice nan awesome mobile . nice product.but , delivery was late . i didn\\'t get any updates for late delivery reason . i had to follow up with amazon chat support . beast for a reason . there are some issues and limitations you fell when move from android apart from it it ‚Äô s fine . okayish

gb version ) from amazon with exchange of one plus 2 . with citibank credit card discount , exchange offer , i got it at 67k . got delviered within 24 hours from amazon and received original phone .

amazon . there was no issue with me . it was seal packed . also the iphone is original and running fine . discount offered was good . dislikes-switching from android to ios is a pain . we need to use paid apps to transfer chats which i didn\\'t use.likes - 1 . best camera for photos and videos . 2 . super battery life . 3 . face id - it is even better now as it supports face masks . 4 . memory management - you don\\'t have to kill apps in background . keep them running as it improves battery life . 5 . user experience - animations and social apps integration are nice . i switche to oneplus 5 to iphone 13 i really enjoyed photo quality . but it\\'s not be friendly ... like android ... still i was not adjust ios my first apple phone .. mind blowing .. loved it worth to buy it . if you are managed money buy then buy it it never feels you waste of money . performance . hand in feel . camera quality at flagship level i am android user . converted to apple to show off ( most will do ) . now i used to it , display quality and touch feel awesome . this is my first flagship mobile . i hope i will use this phone for more years.yet still i don ‚Äô t know much futures in my phone . if my other devices too apple products then would be great ecosystem nan excellent performance have been using this for a week , and its a great device especially for the one\\'s who are shifting from android . the battery backup is good . the security features are great . i always receive notification with regards to security settings of the app and unlike in an android phone where many aspects of access rights are masked . the ui is brilliant and the speed of the phone is great superb mobile üòÉ most durable gets all smartphone fundamentals right , jack of all trades , master of performance and battery life . i have been a 4 year oneplus flagship user , and i can say that there is absolutely no comparison . the software in iphone works very well with the hardware . and it pairs up with my laptop like nothing i ever seen . i can copy on my phone and paste on my laptop and vice versa . i can pick up call on my laptop instead of phone while i am working . can transfer files / images directly to my laptop from phone and vice versa without any loss in quality . i am still exploring the benefits but so far now , it has been incredible . i really love it amazing performance amazing camera quality . iphone 13 best mobile phone delivered in time ! was afraid of getting soap bars but got the real one luckily thanks amazon ! packaging could be better had a thought it wasn ‚Äô t packaged safely.device : 1.excellent camera2.updated ios3.speed is great4.flawless design 5 . battery oh my god apple nailed it you dont need to charge for the whole day believe me being a heavy user i can easily attain 8am-7pm6.kudos to apple for this iphone 13 . this is a very well balanced , all round amazing phone . for people switching to iphone for the first time , this is an excellent choice . the phone has been very consistent , fast and smooth in daily operations , and never misses a beat . the camera is absolutely amazing , battery life is excellent too . apart from this , the build quality is premium , and the software is very optimised and helps you safeguard privacy.overall an amazing iphone , would definitely recommend to anyone who\\'s looking to switch to iphone or even existing iphone users currently on iphone 11 or older . tl ;d r : if you can spend more money and want a better camera go with pro or promaxif you like the apple ecosystem you can get this else stick to androidpros : 1 . good display / brightness ( supports dark mode and you can control white tone which is nice ) . it has 60hz refresh rate but you won\\'t feel the difference imho 2 . good battery life ( iphone 13 series has good battery life but ensure you have a supported charger ) i use my macbook\\'s charger which charges the phone pretty quickly . 3 . best privacy control 4 . camera in portrait mode and selfie camera ( livetext detection is a nice feature ) 5 . fast processor / ram management is good 6 . great resale value / apple supportcons : 1 . screen size ( 6.1 \" which is less in this price segment ) 2 . optical zoom in 13 is not great ( if you want a camera phone go with pro or pro max or android alternative ) 3 . third party app size is huge ( gmail is 300mb / youtube 250 mb ) . no native app lock option 4 . very less os customizations / no fingerprint scanner ( hopeful this gets better with ios 16 ) 5 . no native support for mkv and other video formats ( you can download a third party though ) 6 . native ios apps either require a subscription or are paid . 7 . file management is restricted / not easy to download * multiple * files from telegram / drive best phone everything is great .. amazing product just love it dont think too much its just good phone for this price ! nyc experience nan go for iti am using this phone for more than 6 months now and its working with charm since i bought it.its still feels just like new for handling same as i used on day 1really ios is so polished that you wont be observing any lag or hang state on phone expensive too worth product for iphone 13 , i recommended to all apple iphone user to try this model . nan nan superb battery life and camera quality üëå the product is good but i see some camera quality issues . other than that , the product seems pretty good with the performance and quality . there is a light source flares on camera image when you direct your phone camera on light source . this is creating green light spot on image . it is problem with the iphone lens . i don ‚Äô t recommend this phone if you are a fan of camera . but you can use snapseed app to remove it . as a first time iphone user , i was very confused to buy this iphone 13 or 12 though price difference is manageable ‚Ä¶ so after all reviews and conclusion i went for iphone 13 and now after one month usage i can say i have made very right choice . works very well for me . be it camera , battery , display . everything is just perfect ‚Ä¶ after all it ‚Äô s an iphone . and i am moderate user .. so i don ‚Äô t play heavy games on this device .. hence with normal usage it gives me approx 1.5 days battery back up . hope it helps to choose the right phone for you :-) my first iphone ... software to hardware optimisation is out of the world ... best battery life and screen quality till date ... love the camera and bouquet quality ... just wish could get the 120 hz refresh rate ... and the best part is that i got it in 64k in summer sale and a made in üáÆ üá≥ model ... üíØ üíØ üî• üî• üåÖ üåÖ üòç üòç üòç excellent by all means nan charging is good , best picture quality liked it awesome performance . camera ‚Äô s are beast if you want to switch android to ios , so take iphone 13 and also carry your old android phone because face many problems in iphones , not allowed double apps , two physical sim , etc the phone is very good but the color quality of its frame is not good , i took this phone 4 months ago , now its color is coming out . security at point this is my first iphonephone looks and feels premium in hand , definitely you cannot compare with chinese android phones.battery is sufficient for normal day to day use , if you use hotspot then it will be drained in 5 hours , i don ‚Äô t play games so can ‚Äô t comment.security , os and hardware comprised intact kudos to apple for that , this is where iphone stands out from other phones.volume and camera is amazing and you feel next level if you are switching from chinese smart phones . same dolby and oled display feels premium in iphone.didn ‚Äô t explore much on apple eco system , how ever i understood that you need to spend some extra bugs than usual if you want to be a premium user of apple eco system.nothing comes for free here , in fact you would loose the freedom of being an android user ( less customisation and no side loaders ) in a good way , if you respect your privacy , security and getting premium services in the market you should choose iphone.new users are good to go for iphone 13 with few extra grands with the current offers , you will get extra features that are missing in 12.12 users forget about upgrading to 13 it will be a joke for you , it won ‚Äô t worth it . nice phone . charging is fast . giving 5 stars . received a genuine product . excellent camera quality and display . fantastic is the word to describe the experience . coming from 10 years as android user including pixel 4 . well , i just love my iphone . no complaints . just took some time to adjust to this but now it\\'s perfect . good switch to ios nan everything is perfect in this phone . if you have the budget go for this beauty or if you can wait for iphone 14 . you will never regret your purchase nan before time delivery and original product . apple is beyond doubt the best phone maker have shifted from flagship samsung and liking the change . the fit n fineese of ghe product is amazing , battery backup is superb and airdrop is super fast like a blink . i short must go for iphn 13 pretty well balanced and hopefully will last for 5yrs as my ipad which is running solid since 2017 . make the shift from android as apple ios is buttery smooth . i don ‚Äô t know about others but i loved this phone . it ‚Äô s really faster processor and upgraded camera sensors and lens . i have used android and shifted back to iphone 13 . battery life simply superb . i highly recommend it if you are an iphone lover . sound quality is superior . photo quality is the best . screen is super bright . nan i was not sure whether to buy from amazon or not as i was more willing to buy it directly from apple online store . but because of 11k discount , i ordered it from amazon and the product received is good and i have verified the warranty on apple website using serial number . i switched from oneplus 5t to iphone 13 . the reasons i switched was 1 . battery life of oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and oneplus hardly cared to explain this . i also suspected that oneplus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life . 2 . wanted to get an android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues . 3 . oneplus device also suffered from screenburn.having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iphones lack basic features such as1 . display of date and time on status bar 2 . the rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed . 3 . amazon app does not allow purchase if kindle books on ios devices . 4 . typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a oneplus device.overall , i am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though i must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered . poor battery peefomance , returnnqindow closed and it shows poor performance ‡≤ê ‡≤´‡≥ã‡≤®‡≥ç 13 ultimate camera performance , lots of improvement if you compared to 12‡≤∏‡≤æ‡≤ü‡≤ø‡≤Ø‡≥á & roid ‡≤á‡≤¶‡≤ï‡≥á ? üòÅ i faced heating issues , bulky not recommended phone is just amazing with his performance and the camera quality i don ‚Äô t feel anywhere laggyperformance 10/9 camera 10/10 battery 10/8 selfie camera 10/6 display 10/5 note : if you are looking a phone with good camera and performance just go for it touch feels so premiumamazing productafter a long thought purchased iphone 13 . the phone has not disappointed me . but after using android there are some factors in iphone that are not so user friendly.over priced but a premium product this phone is not good it heated during charging and using more than a hour nice phone and amazon delivered on time brand means the iphone ... excellent phone ... i have both android and ios both are best in their class ... battery life of iphone 13 is superb and camera quality is rocking ... if you want to buy iphon plz buy from amazon it\\'s genuine and superb you\\'re paying money just for the brand name.android devices from samsung and oneplus provide much more value . nan not justified it\\'s cost fantastic phone to own . i was owning iphone se 2020 . because of its smaller size and slow home button , the iphone experience was missing , which i feel now . very snappy and great battery life . very very good mobile.sad to say thing is charging adaptor is not in box.should include adaptor in box.and screen guard and back cover is also suggested to add in the box . excellent product . only drawback is no normal headphones need bluetooth headphones . can\\'t use existing headphones . except camera and some features , nothing is great and not value for money.ios : full of bugs . they give you updates for the bugs , but the updates will give you another bug . not all applications are available and most of them are paid apps.buy a 40k camera and 16k android phone . that is perfect option . you will get decent camera in 16k phones . for pro use , you can use the 40k camera . this is my first iphonei really lived the overall quality and features good overallbattery could be better the media could not be loaded . it\\'s one point solution for all.camera is best in class in every aspect.battery is great.display is lit.performance is great.face id works without a glitch and instant . and siri knows things üòé . the ios is very simple to use and we\\'ll optimised.the sound quality in both calls and media is next level.although price is at higher range depending on the features , i could say it\\'s still a great deal.but one point , i could never digest or justified apple\\'s move not to include audio jack or power adaptor . it\\'s just that they want people to shell out more just to be in the apple infra . the mobile delivers as it claims . for me , what stands out the most is the battery life and camera quality which are very impressive in this mobile . each thing is good but as visible midnight black that is totally different which i find so could be better if it\\'s totally black or z black . nice productcolour 5/5 good but high price when i bought ‚ò∫ ‚ò∫ ‚ò∫ just that the charging adapter was removed that i disliked , everything else is so smooth worth the money ! ! camera is superb . decent battery life and a seamless ios experience . really happy with my purchase camera quality is awesome ! ! overall the phone is superb ! ! the media could not be loaded . my mom gifted me for birthday iphone 13 was really good but sometimes it will heat apart from that mobile is good just go for it , you will not regret . very good built quality best phone from the iphone series its been reviewed so many times and its still the best awesome products for i phone need to improve the battery life dont need an review for this product . everything is upto mark . need improvement on the battery quality though ngl like the ease of use , battery life . thaatssss allll seriously awesome camera and battery wuality build quality : toplook : supereasy to usecamera quality : best awesome excellent thanks a lot amazon for the early delivery . thanks to appario also . received a genuine iphone 13 256 gb and it was verified by apple remote diagnostics . the phone is really awesome .. camera is more than my expectation and music is unbelievable . battery is easily giving me 1.5 days of backup .. amazing experience . loving it ... awesome battery life as a iphone always lacks in and undoubtedly super camera . if you\\'re running an iphone 11 , any of the models in that range , then , yes , the iphone 13 is definitely worth an upgrade . nan loving it , great battery life , camera and controls . nan new experience . first time using iphone . performance is outstanding but having issues regarding apps , music and videos ristricated by apple . rest is superb . amazing phone is simply superb . all apps loading very fast . nan cool i bought a new device , opened the packet and it was a defective device . i contacted amazon for replacement , and they redirected me to apple despite , amazon india has clearly stated that the item is replaceable within 7 days of purchase . apple detected it as a defective piece and it had to be repaired . i reasoned with them that it\\'s a new product and i don\\'t want to get a repaired or refurbished product . but they said since it is bought from amazon they cannot replace it , had it been bought on their website or store they would have surely replaced it.came back to amazon , telling them my experience with apple as it\\'s a defective product . apple is suggesting that would also have replaced it , so amazon please replace it . they denied it flatly . when i asked about why they have mentioned 7 days replacement , on this they don\\'t even say a word but simply repeated themselves that the best advice i have already given to you is that you have to go to apple there is nothing amazon can do about it . the end experience is exhaustion and frustration , customers have only right to these companies \\' fat money and make them richer and richer . this is nothing but a legal extortion racket . switched from oneplus 7pro . this one is really handy . really smooth . happy customer . display performance and feel of the device along with the camera is top notch and perfect . fits perfectly everywhere and screen is big enough to not be too small . really nice product thanks amazon and selller excellent amazing batteryawesome cameraonly drawback i see is 60hz refresh rateif you have the money , go for it . good one but photos taken in this camera changing the originality . call recording feature for indians is needed for free of cost life is gooooood having used pixel , samsung & mi smartphones , i can actually give my review with some comparison.camera of iphone is good but not better than pixel . call quality is good . face recognition is pathetically slow and you will land up keying your passcode many times . phone performance is best . battery time is worst.the worst is apple customer service . they will only do salesman sweet talks and will never resolve your issue . love everything about it good amazing product ! i loved it ‚Ä¶ not up to mark , somany glitches , and when contacts service support and centre physically both advise for formate and reset mobile , if u don ‚Äô t want mobile for show off then go for better options with higher end android.siri not working properheating issuesback button missing nan nan nan too good , screen display doesn ‚Äô t feel like you are working with 60hz display , it feels like 90 hz , phone os is so smooth , camera is excellent battery backup is good . over all excellent phone thank you appario retail ltd.received the product safe and sound .

product and packaging nan good good product good display superb phone i ‚Äô m happy with iphone 13 . it ‚Äô s little bit heavy like iphone 11 but it ‚Äô s fine . hi there , my iphone 13 has problem regarding mic and signal dropsi had iphone xs before never had this issue , after using iphone 13 i got so many complaints about my voice getting drop during callok camera quality supar the battery life and camera of this phone is very good . great filling rating 9/10 camera 9battery 9 pubg 5 hrs smooth + extreme sot 12hrsdisplay 9sound 10design 9performance 9software 10faceid 10 i have ordered one apple i phone 13 256 gb after getting the product it shows some abnormal battery behaviour . after that i tried many times to connect customer service but they are rejecting my call . i spent a huge amount for this product but now i can not replace this item even when the product is not good and its battery life is really bad camera quality very cheapdon\\'t buy it iphone 13 nan decent battery life my i phone display is very dull as well camera pics are very poor in quality for birthday gift i order the mobile early , return policy has been expired later on i unpacked phone staarted for use with in a 3 days camera quality has malfunctioning so i try to connect customer but there is no response from amazon server . lession learn is better we have to go with apple showrooms which will be better option for hight budget investors . nan data transfer from android doesn\\'t work , keeps failing.update : it did eventually work . i deleted some less critical data from my whatsapp backup . i reached out to amazon support , they directed me to apple support . apple support then directed mw to whatsapp support and faqs on whatsapp support asked me to reach out to apple support :/ keeping this at 1 star for overall buying and customer experience . not even a month has been completed and the power button got stucked inside it and phone started to get hang dont know whether the seller send a original piece or not great utter waste of money ! ! after few days of usage , the phone kept turning off repeatedly . it\\'s better to buy iphone from an authentic apple showroom . i dislike the product . the touch doesn\\'t work properly . i wasted 77k on this . it is not switching on no nan defective product , physical sim slot not working , don ‚Äô t buy it online . battery life is worst . even normal use call whatsapp battery drain fast 1 day backup only . don\\'t go for iphone 13 if u want battery backup . and android user don\\'t go for ios lot of disadvantages are there . and don\\'t waste money . u can go for higher range android . pathetic a 70k inr phone sent as used one apple is apple . premium look and feel . price is questionable though . and hopefully it will work for a long period of time , considering the price point . the best phone with the best camera and performance . idk why everywhere people are saying that switching to ios is problematic like moving whatsapp data , contacts etc . it was a one click process for me with the move to ios app . nan we got scammed :( nan perfect phone with all the features and security guranteed . price doesn\\'t matter for such a boss . working like butter üëå too expensive to buy . it should cost not more than 40000 , otherwise the phone is amazing , you should add fingerprint sensor on screen the phone is heating badly when put on charge . and when on use of 15mins , the phone is getting heated up the camera quality is very good and the proceser is actually surpriseing hai na ki nhi hai hai na tu baas nice product . sturdy and best for security . very less data visible or less ads . nice product . loved it . recommended .. afterall its iphone android are way better than ios headset of my iphone is not workingwhat can i do very good phonebut a bit costlyoverall nice phoneless customisabilitya a a a a a a a when people see you carrying this phone they already know that you have just one kidney so they sympathize with you and you get extra benefits because of that.also , this phone can call as well so very good features from apple i would say . buy this ! you won\\'t be disappointed when the glass back breaks and you have to go to the repair shop to repair it as it is the journey that is interesting in life and not the goal.the only thing i didn\\'t like about this phone is that i was expecting kesariya apples but i got a phone . i\\'m just loving it üòç ü•∫ go for 13 rather thn 12 . it\\'s camera quality , battery life nd touch , everything is perfect . ‚ù§ Ô∏è defective piece , can ‚Äô t contact the seller too i received used mobile nan those who said iphone doesn ‚Äô t hang , they are wrong , using it from last 2 months and the phone got hanged for few seconds while using some apps . front camera wasn ‚Äô t working . got a defective piece . used it for a week ... not bad . battery life is very good but no difference between iphone 12 and this i have not money im not purchase big cost phon but i\\'m see in amazon and im thinking one day complete my dream go for it , it\\'s simply awesome . i loved the phone . it is little expensive but , worth it.picture quality is awe ... nan no words the media could not be loaded . very good best buy just buy don\\'t waste time on and rode some is best jai apple only apple is best the media could not be loaded . i like it , dark red colour is so catchy . and quickly noticeable.and would prefer to buy this phone . nan i think iphone is over hyped , it doesn\\'t support all your bank apps most of the apps you want to use are not supported by the phone . phone is excellent . ios is very smooth . battery backup excellent . the problem lies with the accessories that you will be forced to purchase . there is no charger . ( additional rs . 1900 for apple charger ) . the cable is type c to lightning . ( additional rs . 1000 for certified belkin usb to lightning cable ; apple cable > 2000 ) . no headphones . ( additional rs . 2000 for other brand earbuds ) . no cover and screen guard . so for this price you will get phone , cable , sim ejector pin . im not satisfied with this cable , they should have provided usb to lightning cable . amazon serve the best product all i want to say , i wish i had this and apple products are super successful and amazon serve these product in short time it is a very nice product by apple . legendry handy machine . it will make me very happy . feel very satisfied with it . thank my mom and dad to give me iphone 13 long time android user here , i bought the iphone 13 as a replacement of my android mid range and also to shoot youtube videos as i think an iphone offers better value than any 60-70 k vlogging cam . absolutely love the camera , battery backup , the build quality-just no words there . unlike android , i do not have to worry for extended zoom and g calls--very reliable . definitely , apple got another long time iphone customer . touch & video quality awesome , face lock is superbattery is very goodsound quality is awesomecolour is cool ‚Ä¶ , same as i phone 12 üòë . who so ever is reading this review i suggest go for i phone 12 as this iphone offers well stable ios and one of the best hardwares this is a nice phone to buy worst phone , battery dies in year , it seems apple is deliberately giving poor batteries in their 70 k phones . worst company actually im a android user , used samsung galaxy s20 plus more than a year & moved to ios by iphone 13 . brand wise good phone . though expensive but better for those who don\\'t have much use and they are looking for safety quality and brand i didn\\'t use the product but this is very hard security device and it\\'s my dream .. and you also purchase the iphone 13 so i ordered this phone from apple ‚Äô s official website . and have been using this for the past 1 week and trust me it has one of the best batteries you will find on any phone . i am a moderate user when it comes to cellphones i . e the basic instagram facebook whatsapp youtube and netflix . this phone if charged fully lasts up to 24 hours if used moderately without any heavy gaming.the reason i am writing this review is because of the useless comments of people that are rated high but can ‚Äô t actually afford this phone.coming from one plus 6t this phone is a huge jump ( i love my one plus ‚Ä¶ still using it as my work phone ) but it is obviously a lot to adjust to since we are completely switching to a different os seems like shifting to a different nation all together.anyway .. if you do have a good enough budget you should definitely go for this beauty the price is directly proportional to the features . everything is perfect no issues . if you want to switch to an iphone , this is the perfect phone . good but buy i phone 12 for this price that is much good in my opinion and 11 pro i i have made a mistake of going with the hype and buying the iphone ... it\\'s a useless piece of trash for 50k . no functionality whatsoever . just a piece of showoff , nothing else . i also have put up an ad olx.rather go for samsung s series have been a oneplus user since 2016 . was in love with every product of theirs until they merged with oppo and ruined up their lovely oxygenos . had recently bought a oneplus 9r and was fed up with constant bugs , glitches and occasional freezes . my oneplus 7 was much better than my oneplus 9r which sums up how much oneplus has messed up things in recent months.anyway , decided to upgrade and didn ‚Äô t have much options in android apart from samsung as google have decided not to sell their high end devices here in india . i ‚Äô m not a big fan of samsung ‚Äô s oneui although it has been excellent in recent years in terms of software updates . hence decided to shift to the world ‚Äô s favourite apple ecosystem.it ‚Äô s been 2 weeks of using this device now and i think it ‚Äô s a really good change overall especially the software part . currently on ios 15.6 and it ‚Äô s super stable with 0 bugs and glitches so far . was on ios 16 public beta as well for a couple of days which seemed really good with some major improvements but had to downgrade back to 15.6 because beta os doesn ‚Äô t support banking apps . the camera quality is excellent just like all other iphones . the display quality is excellent and bright enough to use in sunlight . speakers are better than any oneplus phone in market.overall , it ‚Äô s great but not perfect . needs few improvements for sure though . i miss oneplus ‚Äô 65w warp charging sometimes which was a life saver but the battery life on iphone 13 has been really exceptional which makes up for it . easily lasts up an entire day in office with a 75 % charge . also , i think google ‚Äô s keyboard gboard is better than apple ‚Äô s in terms of word prediction and haptics . so nice to know apple working on improvements in that aspect ( haptics included in ios 16 keyboard ) . a 120 hz screen would have been really good as it ‚Äô s not a budget device . for that , you ‚Äô ll have to look at the pro models which cost more than ‚Çπ 100k even during sale.overall i ‚Äô d give this device a 9.5 out of 10 . please note that i have been only using this device for a couple of weeks . will update the review after a month or so and will be able to tell more about the device . very costly phone . it is heating very randomly also . buy samsung m53 . it has nice front camera quality and ü¶ç üç∏ . 1st copy product .. duplicate .. do not buy ... amazon should gv a solution to this kind of expensive products like a 1month period of return if there any quality issues dont buy apple from amazon go for samsung or anything else but not iphone or buy iphone 12 or o not at all worth the wait and price . i phone 11 and 12 were better version at this price points . nothing much has been changed . check before you buy and make a good decision . i had a bad experience ‚Ä¶ . my unlock button is not working properly , at times it ‚Äô s not unlocking my phone . i bought the phone from india on the first week of its launch . country of origin \\u200e china , you can decide your own . but india origin and manufacture only . thank you for considering it . no biometrics with many ui flaws . too expensive at 90k range.better wait for new versions so that the price will drop for this version substantially . go for i phone 12 guy\\'s .. i suggest you for it .. buy i phone 12 only . ok could\\'ve been better , this is just such a small update .. i\\'d say stick to your old iphone 12 if you have it .. if not then maybe think of buying this same as iphone 12 expect camara not satisfied go with i phone 12 if you want best camara then i phone 13 slight speed difference , more batter backup for more than 12 not worth it go for 12 instead .. no difference at all very expensive and not working well as i was thinking about it so i think this is my wrong selection . you should be a bigggggg bot to buy this phoneyou could get iphone 12 pro that ‚Äô s the best üòÇ this product is duplicate of iphone 12 only camera design changed . very low quality of this product buy samsung mobile phone ignore the negative comments made by amateurs.reasons for upgrade : 1 . camera : bigger camera aperture , ois , cinematic mode . low light pictures are outstanding as you can see the 2nd picture of the flower taken at night . also some of the pictures during daylight for reference . 2 . battery : apple has really done a good job in battery management . it\\'s giving a good battery back up . 3 . processor : new a15 processor and better performance . 4 . software : this is the usual strong point of any iphone with ios . 5 . storage : not to forget you ‚Äô re now getting 128 gigs as base storage compared to 64 gigs last year on base model price.who should buy this phone : 1 . if you\\'re already using an iphone 12 don\\'t bother to upgrade . wait for next year release . 2 . those who are using iphone 10 or previous versions can surely feel much of a difference . 3 . price gap : iphone 12 is 70,000 inr with no offers at present . iphone 13 with 6000 discount on hdfc cards makes the actual price around 74000 . it makes no sense to save 4000 and buy an year old device iphone 12 if you ‚Äô re upgrading from iphone 10 or previous versions . 4 . iphone 12 purchase will only make sense compared to iphone 13 if it\\'s price gets reduced to 55000.customer expectations : 1 . at least an always on display . 2 . on display fingerprint scanner . 3 . a 90hz refresh rate if not 120hz for iphone 13 model . in india we are paying a lot for base models . i ‚Äô ve been using iphone 6s for almost last 6 years . the only problem i ever faced in its entire lifespan was the battery life . and apple has finally broken that . apart from amazing user experience , camera , and all that is great about iphone , the battery life of iphone 13 is simply awesome . do not doubt for a second if you want to upgrade your phone . jus go for it . may not be the best one to upgrade to , but i absolutely loved this phone as a first time iphone user . battery and camera are better than expected . i have purchased my first iphone every . i can say camera is best in market ( vivo v70 pro + is biggest competitor ) , build quality is good with lots of new feature.if you are iphone 12 user , i will not suggest to you . because there is no much difference between 12 and 13.but if you are purchasing new iphone or upgrading from 11 or below , then you can recommend this as best option.iphone competitor samsung is providing foldable phone but they are not worth to buy because foldable are attractive for the first time only , after that you will see the bend clearly.feedback : this is fully satisfied with cool features superb mobile from apple . i am having a great exprience with it after upgrading from my xr . it feels lighter than my xr too & find the display really crisp as earlier i was using an lcd display after iphone 4 , i am going back to the apple ecosystem , by purchasing iphone 13 . in the meantime i have used several android and windows phones . this is the best , though at a much higher cost . the battery life is a surprise , with a good life of over almost two days , with normal use . i wanted to upgrade from iphone 7 to latest and i believe i did right in purchasing iphone 13 . very happy with look and feel , performance and battery the phone is really good and the response is better than my earlier iphone 11 . camera is fab and the cinematic mode really do the magic . however , it is too expensive for the price , which is mainly bcoz of the apple brand . also , apple not providing charger for environment purposes , is fake and i do not agree to it . it is another way of selling accessories at extremely high and bizarre margins . if you are switching from qndroid to iso , then this is a good decision . excellent battery life and camera . just go for it . scores high on style , looks , great camera , fast . iphone set-up from previous versions of iphone is very very fast and smooth . entire set-up took just 10-15 mins and everything was copied over w / o any loss of data . face id set-up is very powerful . battery life could be still better . obviously price point could be a little more affordable . the iphone 13 is the best iphone ever . fantastic phone . the best camera . fastest processor . and offcourse a status symbol . go for it . it\\'s the best smart phone . it ‚Äô s a great upgrade ‚Ä¶ camera is good .. the media could not be loaded . best phone ever used ‚ù§ Ô∏è i switched from oneplus 5t to iphone 13 . the reasons i switched was 1 . battery life of oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and oneplus hardly cared to explain this . i also suspected that oneplus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life . 2 . wanted to get an android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues . 3 . oneplus device also suffered from screenburn.having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iphones lack basic features such as1 . display of date and time on status bar 2 . the rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed . 3 . amazon app does not allow purchase if kindle books on ios devices . 4 . typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a oneplus device.overall , i am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though i must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered . just received this in the morning . my mother loves the red colour . also , the camera ‚Äô s pretty impressive . haven ‚Äô t tested the battery yet . but , i ‚Äô m sure it ‚Äô s much better than the previous versions.the best part is that red colour ‚Äô s not flashy . camera is ok charging speed is very slow even with 12 watt charger if your shifting from andriod in my opinion it ‚Äô s not worth it this phone has amazing features idk why people hate it this deserves to be liked more as the phone even has cinematic mode perfect for people who make movies excellent , there is no phone like iphone the smartphone marketplace has changed drastically over the span of the past few years . over the years , it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months . amid these challenging times apple , like a bunch of other companies , has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iphones . in this series , the company , as is customary , announced the iphone 13 as its successor to last year ‚Äô s iphone 12.the newly launched iphone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iphone 12 , which includes a smarter camera , a brighter display , a bigger battery and of course , a more advanced processor to name a few . then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage . sure , it ‚Äô s a tad bit heavier than the iphone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iphone models , like the iphone 11 or the iphone xr that i have been using , for what seems like aeons now , you will be grateful for everything that the iphone 13 offers . i always wanted to buy an iphone this one is just made for me it\\'s has a very good camera and i just love the look.if you are going for iphone than i highly recommend this phone to you other than other than 12 or 11 . best phone ever ‚ù§ Ô∏è iphone 13 256 gb variant purchased from reliance digital really value for money phone especially battery back up is mind blowing overall good phone . the media could not be loaded . everything about this phone is best ‚ô• Ô∏ègreat battery üîã great camera üì∏ great design ‚ô•
